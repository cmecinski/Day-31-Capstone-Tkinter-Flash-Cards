# Day-31-Capstone-Tkinter-Flash-Cards

Created Flash Cards App that will help you learn vocabulary or other topics.
Given a csv file with two columns, it will prompt the user with a definition of a random word and give 3 seconds for you to answer.

After 3 seconds it will flip to a new image with the answer you should have given.

If you got it correct you can press the check mark and get a new word to repeat the process.
This will also remove the word from the list in a new created csv called "words_to_learn.csv"

If you got the word wrong you can press the X to get a new word and keep the word in the list for you to try again later.
